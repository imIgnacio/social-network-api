## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list and built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express and Mongoose packages, it uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
